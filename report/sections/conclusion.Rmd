# Conclusion


In higher education, surveying is an important technique used to gather important feedback and make improvements to the programs. Studies have shown that monetary incentives can improve survey response rates. In our field experiment, we set out to understand the effects of direct incentives and philanthropic incentives on survey response rates among MIDS alumni. 

Our experiment was not able to find statistically significant positive effects on response rate. On the country, we found negative results of monetary incentives on survey response rates. The negative effect of direct incentive is significant at 90th percentile, while effect of philanthropic incentive is not statistically significant. We also observed heterogeneous treatment effects where female alumni responded favorably to philanthropic incentive, but the result was not statistically significant either. 

The findings from this experiment suggests that monetary incentives are overall not effective among MIDS alumni. A good future extension of our work could make hypothesis and do experiments to investigate why monetary incentives are not effective among MIDS alumni. The findings can contribute to the survey practices in graduate schools and higher education.
